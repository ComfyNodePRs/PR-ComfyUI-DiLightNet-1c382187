# ComfyUI-DiLightNet (WIP)

ComfyUI nodes to use [DiLightNet](https://github.com/iamNCJ/DiLightNet)

These nodes can run DiLightNet, but does not contain the Dust3r or BlenderPy implementations to create lighting within Comfy. Expect those to be added to seperate repos when time allows.

## Examples
Example workflow can be found in `example_workflows`

The following output is based on example inputs from the DiLightNet repo given a lighting environment that has a reddish hue.
